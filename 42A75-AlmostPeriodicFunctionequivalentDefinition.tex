\begin{document}
There is an equivalent definition of almost periodic function due to Bochner:

A function $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is \emph{almost periodic} if 
every sequence of translates of $f$ has a uniformly convergent subsequence.

Not only is this definition simpler to state than that of Bohr, 
but it  also generalizes to functions on groups.
