\begin{document}
Let $f$ be a piecewise \PMlinkid{regular}{1146} real-valued function defined on some interval $[a,b]$, such that $f$ has only a finite number of discontinuities and extrema in $[a,b]$. Then the Fourier series of this function converges to $f$ when $f$ is continuous and to the arithmetic mean of the left-handed and right-handed \PMlinkid{limit}{2950} of $f$ at a point where it is discontinuous.
