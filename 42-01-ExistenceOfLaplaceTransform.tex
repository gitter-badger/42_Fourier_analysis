\begin{theorem}
For every measurable function $f \colon [0,\infty) \to \mathbb{C}$, if there exists a real number $t_0$ such that
 \[ \int_0^\infty e^{-st_0} |f(s)| \, ds \]
converges, then the Laplace transform $\mathcal{L}(f)$ is
a well-defined function from $\{t \in \mathbb{C} \mid \Re t > t_0 \}$ to 
$\mathbb{C}$.  Furthermore, the Laplace transform function is analytic.
